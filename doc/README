Requirements:
For viewing:
	Adobe Acobat Reader (acroread) version 5 does a nice job of
	smoothing the lines.

If you want to make changes and compile your own copy:
	LaTeX
	Ghostscript
	SIunits (Tex) for the mathematical symbols.
	PSTricks

On Debian-derived systems, install the following packages:
	ghostscript
	texlive-science (for SIunits)
	texlive-pstricks (for PSTricks)
	texlive-lang-cyrillic (for Cyrillic text)
