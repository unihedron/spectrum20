%Reflection{\psset{linestyle=solid}\textcolor{white}{\Large Reflection}\begin{itemize}	\item Reflection of EMR is dependent on wavelength as demonstrated when visible light and radio waves bounce off objects that X-Rays would pass through. Microwaves, which have a large wavelength compared to visible light, will bounce off metal mesh in a microwave oven whereas visible light will pass through.		%Mirror	\rput(0.5\linewidth,-.6){\input{pictures/reflection.tex}}		\vspace{0.72in}	\item EMR of any wavelength can be reflected, however, the reflectivity of a material depends on many factors including the wavelength of the incident beam.	\item The angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) and angle of reflection ($\theta_r$) are the same.\end{itemize}}
