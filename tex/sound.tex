\item Although sound, ocean waves, and heartbeats are not electromagnetic, they are included on this chart as a frequency reference. Other properties of electromagnetic waves are different from sound waves.

\item Sound waves are caused by an oscillating compression of molecules. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum such as outer space.

\item The speed of sound in air at sea level is 1240kph (770mph), and much faster in water at 5328kph (3311mph).

% From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range
\item Humans can only hear sound between $\approx$20Hz to $\approx$20kHz. Some bats can hear sound up to 200kHz.

\item Infrasound (below 20Hz) can be sensed by internal organs and touch.

Frequencies in the 0.2Hz range are often the cause of motion sickness.


\item The 88 piano keys of the Equal Temperament scale are accurately located on the frequency chart. The musical note A (A4 or A440 at 440Hz) is depicted on the chart as \pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=HumanAudioColor]{\textcolor{white}{A4}}.

\item Over the ages people have striven to divide the continuous audio frequency spectrum into individual musical notes that have harmonious relationships besides the octave. Microtonal musicians study various scales. One recent count lists 4700 different musical scales.
