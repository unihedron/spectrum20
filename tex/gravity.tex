{\Large Gravitational Waves}

\begin{itemize}

\item Gravity is the mysterious force which holds large objects together and binds our planets, stars, and galaxies together. No links have been established between gravity and electromagnetic radiation or the other physical forces like; the Weak force, the Electromagnetic force, and the Strong force.

\item Gravity is theorized to warp space and time. In fact, gravity is responsible for bending light as observed by the gravity-lens example of distant stars and galaxies.

\item ``Gravitational waves'' appear as ripples in space-time travelling at the speed of light. Long theorized, a gravitational wave was first detected in 2015, and was caused by the merger of two black holes 1.4 billion light years away.
